-- Load raw exchange rate data to PostgreSQL
-- This is a placeholder SQL file for the Airflow DAG
-- In a real implementation, this would contain SQL for loading exchange rate data

SELECT 'Loading raw exchange rate data to PostgreSQL...' as status;

-- Example of what this might look like:
-- INSERT INTO raw_exchange_data (from_currency, to_currency, exchange_rate, date)
-- SELECT * FROM temp_exchange_data WHERE processing_date = '{{ ds }}';

-- Load raw exchange rate data to PostgreSQL
-- This is a placeholder SQL file for the Airflow DAG
-- In a real implementation, this would contain SQL for loading exchange rate data

SELECT 'Loading raw exchange rate data to PostgreSQL...' AS status;

-- Example of what this might look like:
-- INSERT INTO raw_exchange_data (from_currency, to_currency, exchange_rate, date)
-- SELECT from_currency, to_currency, exchange_rate, date 
-- FROM temp_exchange_data 
-- WHERE processing_date = '2024-01-01'; -- would use Airflow date macro in production

-- Load raw stock data to PostgreSQL
-- This is a placeholder SQL file for the Airflow DAG
-- In a real implementation, this would contain SQL for loading stock data

SELECT 'Loading raw stock data to PostgreSQL...' AS status;

-- Example of what this might look like:
-- INSERT INTO raw_stock_data (symbol, date, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume)
-- SELECT symbol, date, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume 
-- FROM temp_stock_data 
-- WHERE processing_date = '2024-01-01'; -- would use Airflow date macro in production
